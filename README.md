# 🍩 3D ASCII Donut
This project is a C implementation of a minimalist 3D rendering engine capable of displaying a rotating torus (donut) in the terminal, using only ASCII characters to simulate light and volume.

It is based on the famous code by Andy Sloane, deconstructed and rewritten to understand 3D geometry concepts, projection, and low-level memory management.
